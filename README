                       Net::SNMP, version 4.0.0 

NAME

    Net::SNMP - Object oriented interface to SNMP 

DESCRIPTION

    The Net::SNMP module implements an object oriented interface to the 
    Simple Network Management Protocol.  Perl applications can use the  
    module to retrieve or update information on a remote host using the 
    SNMP protocol.  The module supports SNMP version-1, SNMP version-2c 
    (Community-Based SNMPv2), and SNMP version-3.  The Net::SNMP module 
    assumes that the user has a basic understanding of the Simple Network 
    Management Protocol and related network management concepts.

INSTALLATION

    To install the Net::SNMP module and all of it's dependencies directly
    from the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) execute the 
    command:

	perl -MCPAN -e 'install Net::SNMP'

    The Net::SNMP module can also be installed using the distribution file
    downloaded from CPAN.  After unpacking the file, perform one of the 
    following steps while in the top level directory of the distribution:

        a.  Create a makefile by running Perl against Makefile.PL and 
            then run make:

                perl Makefile.PL
                make test
                make install

        b.  Copy or move the entire directory structure (including 
            files) located under the lib/Net directory in the 
            distribution into a directory named Net in a Perl library 
            directory.

REQUIREMENTS

    Net::SNMP uses syntax that is not supported in versions of Perl 
    earlier than v5.6.0. 

    The non-core modules Crypt::DES, Digest::MD5, Digest::SHA1, and 
    Digest::HMAC are needed to support SNMPv3.

DOCUMENTATION

    Documentation is included as part of the Net::SNMP module in 
    Plain Old Documentation (POD) format.
